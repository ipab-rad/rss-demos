# RSS Demos

This repository contains computer vision demos for the RSS module at the School of Informatics at The University of Edinburgh.

Each demo is an IPython Notebook which can be viewed in github by clicking on it or with the [IPython Notebook Viewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org)

In order to execute the code you have to run the IPython Notebook on a computer with Psynython 2.7 and OpenCV 3.0.
